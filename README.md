# Maxwells-Equations-FDM
Solving the reduced Maxwells equations in 1D using SBP-SAT and SBP-Projection.


 script for the homogeneous domain.
One script for the case where different parts of the domain uses different relative permeabilities, thus uses an "interface" to connect the two parts of the domain. This is only implemented with SBP-Projection (yet)
